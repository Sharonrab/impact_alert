# Impact Alert System

This repository contains the Impact Alert System for the CMPE264 project of David G. and Sharon R. This system is designed to detect objects moving towards a camera, and produce an audible alert before impact.

## Platform

Multiple platforms are being explored before implementation can begin. Currently, we are testing MATLAB Simulink and OpenCV on both PC and Mac. There is also the possibilty of porting the code to a microcontroller or mobile platform.
